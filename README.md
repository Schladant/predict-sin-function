# Predicting the Sin Wave Function

This project was developed to demonstrate how a RNN could predict the next event in a temporal signal.

For temporal signals, the sin wave function was used.

`predict_complex_funct.ipynb` predicts complex sin wave functions and uses `tensorflow.keras.layers.SimpleRNN`.

`predict_sin_lstm.ipynb` predicts basic sin wave functions and uses `tensorflow.keras.layers.LSTM`.
